<h2>A Machine is NOT an Island</h2>
<p>When a machine is connected via a network to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1, it can integrate with the MIS (Manufacturing Information System) of the factory. When integrated, the machine stops being a stand-alone <em>island</em>, but instead becomes part of a larger, coherent scheme.</p>
<p>An MIS communicates with the iChen<sup>®</sup> Server via the <a href="api_reference.html">Open Protocol</a>™.</p>
<p>The MIS must <a href="messages_reference.html#joinmessage">JOIN</a> to the iChen<sup>®</sup> Server with a password that has the required authority (see <a href="code/enums.html#Filters">here</a> for details).</p>
<p>The iChen<sup>®</sup> Server sends Open Protocol™ messages to the MIS and the MIS responds with appropriate reply messages:</p>

<h2>Integrated Security</h2>
<p>Normally, the controller on a machine controls access via a number of <em>password levels</em>, with higher levels having wider access powers than lower levels. Typically, an password level of zero indicates no authority to do anything on the machine.</p>
<p>Manually updating and managing password levels on multiple machines is time-consuming, resource-intensive and error-prone. It is also a significant security risk - for example, it is usually infeasible to change all the passwords on each machine each time when a staff has resigned or been transferred, and to redistribute the new passwords to all remaining staff. As a result, machine access in a typical production environment is usually kept loose, difficult to track and trace.</p>
<p>The iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 provides <em>audit trail</em> features that automatically logs each and every single change of setting made on each connected machine, as well as logging each and every alarm condition that ever occurred. Even though this provides tremendous value for tracing out problems <em>after they happened</em>, it does not help in tracking <em>who</em> was responsible for the changes, and certainly does not help in <em>preventing</em> unauthorized changes in the first place.</p>
<p>In order to provide <em>centrally-controlled</em> authentication and authorization, the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 can integrate with the MIS for complete lock-down and control of access to all machines.</p>
<p>When a machine is connected to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1, the internal <em>password levels</em> stored in its controller are <strong>disabled</strong> in favor of centralized security. Therefore, no operator can gain access to a machine that is connected to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 by entering an internal password.</p>
<p>The operator instead must enter a password that is unique to him/her only, and not shared by anybody else in the company. Essentially, the operator's personal password <em>identifies</em> the person involved. Some companies integrate <em>staff card readers</em> to machine controllers and dispense with the need to manually enter passwords altogether.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the personal password of the operator, the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 sends to the MIS a <a href="messages_reference.html#loginoperatormessage"><code>LoginOperatorMessage</code></a> message containing that password (or the staff number read from a staff badge). Upon receiving this message, the MIS should authenticate the operator by checking in its centralized database of valid passwords, and matching a unique <em>operator ID</em> to the operator.</p>
<p>If authenticated, the MIS should send an <a href="messages_reference.html#operatorinfomessage"><code>OperatorInfoMessage</code></a> message to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1. This message should contain information regarding the authorization of that particular operator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique, numeric, non-zero operator ID <em>(some controllers display this information on-screen)</em></li>
<li>Name of the operator <em>(some controllers display this information on-screen)</em></li>
<li>Access level from zero (no access rights) to ten (full access rights)</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon receiving this reply message, the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 instructs the machine to recognize the appropriate access level of the operator, in addition to logging the operator's ID for records.</p>
<p>If the password provided to the MIS cannot be authenticated (i.e. if the password does not match any in its database), the MIS should simply ignore this request or reply with an <a href="messages_reference.html#operatorinfomessage"><code>OperatorInfoMessage</code></a> containing an <em>operator ID</em> of zero and an <em>access level</em> of zero.</p>
<p>When a staff member resigns and is transferred to another position, his/her password can simply be disabled from within the MIS, and the staff can no longer gain access to any machine.</p>

<section id="integrated-job-scheduling" class="level2 prose">
<h2>Integrated Job Scheduling</h2>
<p>A machine can participate in the capacity planning of an MIS, the MIS is joined to the iChen<sup>®</sup> Server with a password that has the <code>JobCards</code> authority (see <a href="code/enums.html#Filters">here</a> for details).</p>
<p>The MIS allocates and schedules units of work to individual machines via the concept of <em>Job Cards</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>Job Card</em> is single <em>unit of work</em> to be performed by one single machine. It can represent a single <em>production order</em>, or <em>part</em> of a production order that is allocated among certain number of machines during a particular time. The MIS system is responsible for tracking, allocating and scheduling machines to satisfy</p>
<p>Typically a <em>job card</em> is identified by a unique textual ID value (which typically contains the unique <em>order number</em> that is it part of). Examples of job card ID's:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>ORDER12345-5-003</code> <em>(The third machine for the first line item of order #12345)</em></p>
<p><code>C987-X2016(03)-42-005/008</code> <em>(The fifth machine out of eight allocated to batch 42 of order <code>X2016(03)</code> of customer #987)</em></p>
<p><code>JKB-135/63</code> <em>(63rd item for project code <code>JKB-135</code>)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A job card also typically contains at least the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unique serial number of a machine to perform the workload</li>
<li>The unique textual ID of a mold to use for production</li>
<li>The total quantity of products to be produced (or, when divided by the number of cavities in the specified mold, the number of production cycles)</li>
</ul>
<p>When connected to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1, a number of additional screens are enabled on a machine. The machine <em>requests</em> a valid list of job cards from the MIS by sending the <a href="messages_reference.html#requestjobcardslistmessage"><code>RequestJobCardsListMessage</code></a> message with the machine's serial number.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the <a href="messages_reference.html#requestjobcardslistmessage"><code>RequestJobCardsListMessage</code></a> message, the MIS should search through its internal scheduling system and present the machine with all the valid job cards for that particular machine at that particular time of request.</p>
<p>Typically, only one job card is allocated to an individual machine at any time, so in most cases the list will contain only one job card item. In rare cases, when new ad-hoc jobs are inserted into the normal production schedule (i.e. <em>barge-in</em>), the list may contain more than one job card for the operator to choose from; however, in the interest of reducing operator errors, such practice should be avoided.</p>
<p>Depending on the authority of the operator, the machine typically should refuse to start production unless a valid job card is loaded. This can greatly reduce operator errors.</p>
<p>The MIS provides the list of valid job cards to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 via a <a href="messages_reference.html#jobcardslistmessage"><code>JobCardsListMessage</code></a> message. See also <a href="messages_reference.html#JobCard">here</a> for the format of each job card.</p>
<p>Each job card contains the unique ID of a mold to use. The machine then loads the set of parameter settings for the specified mold. Depending on the authority of the operator, he/she may not have authority to alter these settings, or may have only limited authority to alter certain settings but not others. This can greatly reduce operator errors during setup.</p>
<p>Each job card also contains the total quantity to be produced. Each piece of product counts as one, and so for multi-cavity molds, the total number of production cycles to be performed is the total quantity divided by the number of cavities.</p>
<p>The machine counts the quantity of &quot;good&quot; products produced, and when the requested quantity is fulfilled, the machine stops production and transit to an idle state. Depending on the authority of the operator, the machine may refuse to continue production beyond the requested quantity. This can greatly reduce the amount of over-production and wastage due to operator oversight.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the above-mentioned quantity control, the MIS should provide the current quantity already produced for each job card in addition to the total requested quantity. The machine, upon loading the job card, resets its internal &quot;good&quot; parts count to this quantity and starts incrementing from that.</p>
<p>The MIS is also responsible for up-keeping the current quantity produced for each job card based on counting the cycle data messages sent by the machine (see <a href="messages_reference.html#cycledatamessage">here</a> for details). In order to receive cycle data messages, the MIS must be joined to the iChen<sup>®</sup> Server with a password that has the <code>CycleData</code> authority (see <a href="code/enums.html#Filters">here</a> for details). The machine is not supposed to track job card quantity numbers on a permanent basis; it is the responsibility of the MIS to do so.</p>

<section id="integrated-mold-management" class="level2 prose">
<h2>Integrated Mold Management</h2>
<p>The iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 stores mold settings data locally and automatically serves the correct data set upon request by a machine's controller, transcoding the data sets wherever necessary to the appropriate versions acceptable by the requesting controller.</p>
<p>The iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 also <em>backs up</em> the mold data sets to secure, protected and fault-tolerant cloud storage to ensure that no critical data is ever lost. All these are performed automatically and behind-the-scene. Normally, the MIS does not need to care about this.</p>
<p>In certain circumstances, however, the MIS would like to maintain such mold data sets centrally. There are a few ways to accomplish this:</p>
<section id="request-live-mold-data" class="level3 prose">
<h3>(1) Request Live Mold Data</h3>
<p>The MIS sends a <a href="messages_reference.html#requestmolddatamessage"><code>RequestMoldDataMessage</code></a> to the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 for a particular machine (based on that machine's unique serial number), which will respond with a <a href="messages_reference.html#molddatamessage"><code>MoldDataMessage</code></a> containing the current settings data of the specified machine in the form of an binary array. The MIS can then store this data centrally.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-the-mold-data-rest-api" class="level3 prose">
<h3>(2) Use the Mold Data REST API</h3>
<p>The iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 exposes a <a href="REST_api_reference.html">REST API</a> that allows the MIS to inspect, add and delete stored mold data sets. It is up to the MIS to synchronize its mold data sets database with that in the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1.</p>
</section>
<section id="mold-data-integration-module-optional" class="level3 prose">
<h3>(3) Mold Data Integration Module (Optional)</h3>
<p>An optional <em>Mold Data Integration Module</em> can be installed in the iChen<sup>®</sup> System 4.1 to completely by-pass its internal mold data storage, always going to the MIS instead.</p>
<p>The <em>Mold Data Integration Module</em> is a separately-charged product.</p>
